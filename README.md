## About

This was a challenge for the job interview at hokify.

We get an object as input and another one with our changes. The algorithm performs various checks on the update and input object to either find and update/delete the objects keys OR to add a completly new key to the inputs object.

## Run/Build

First clone the repository, cd into it and run ```npm install```. After that, either run the test command to check if the tests pass or build it with ```npm run build```, you can then import the ```build.js``` file from the ```dist/``` folder, it exports the function called ```update```.
